司令官 - A prototype, object-oriented command handler for discordgo.

This is a work-in-progress command handler which shall later replace the current command handler used in [shinpuru](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru).

If you are interested how to use this package, see the [basic example](examples/basic).

This command handler is strongly inspired by [Lukaesebrot's](https://github.com/Lukaesebrot) package [dgc](https://github.com/Lukaesebrot/dgc).
